In AWK, gsub(/ /,"_", variable) replaces all blanks with underscores, updating
the variable itself.

You could end up with something like:

 ls | awk '{new=$0; gsub(/ /,"_",new); printf("mv %s %s\n", $0, new);}'

Who could you actually run it, instead of printing the commands? Pipe it to
sh, or wrap it inside $().
